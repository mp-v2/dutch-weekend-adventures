### Almost Outdoors
- Limburg province has a growing population of wild cats. Areas here must be wild enough to support such populations: https://wilderness-society.org/wild-cat-population-grows-in-the-netherlands/. Dutch study: https://www.ark.eu/nieuws/2018/minimaal-14-zeldzame-wilde-katten-nederland.
