It is along the Dutch-German border near Nijmegen.
- There are two uninhabited islands: Rottumeroog and Rottumerplaat, in the Wadden Sea.

- Outdoor trips with Staatsbosbeheer (the Dutch nature charity, similar to the National Trust in the UK) are quite cheap and look good. Can include multi-day outings including wild camping with rangers as your guide: https://www.staatsbosbeheer.nl/uit-in-de-natuur/excursies
