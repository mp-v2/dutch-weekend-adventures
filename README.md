# Dutch Weekend Adventures
An open-source list of adventures you can reach when based in the Netherlands

The aim is to build this into a resource for enabling and encouraging adventure and exploration, even from the safe harbour of the Netherlands.

Each subpage is for one type of activity, and they're split up into how 'real' the adventure is. 

For example, for climbing this can be described as: 
- Real Outdoors: Real, natural rock is best
- Almost Outdoors: Strongly weathered artificial structures (e.g. buildering on old WW2 bunkers)
- Kind of Outdoors (if you squint): Fully-artificial but contains some aspect of outdoor (e.g. a bouldering gym with an outdoor area split into 'boulders').
