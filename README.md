# Dutch Weekend Adventures
An open-source list of adventures you can reach when based in the Netherlands

Each subpage is for one type of activity

They're split up into how 'real' the adventure is. 

For climbing, this can be described as: 
- Real, natural rock is best
- Strongly weathered artificial structures (e.g. buildering on old WWII bunkers) is next
- Fully-artificial but contains some aspect of outdoor (e.g. a bouldering gym with an outdoor area split into 'boulders').
