# Dutch Weekend Adventures
An open-source list of adventures you can reach when based in the Netherlands

Each subpage is for one type of activity

They're split up into how 'real' the outdoor-feel is. 

For example, for climbing this can be described as: 
- Real Outdoors: Real, natural rock is best
- Almost Outdoors: Strongly weathered artificial structures (e.g. buildering on old WWII bunkers) is next
- Kind of Outdoors (if you squint): Fully-artificial but contains some aspect of outdoor (e.g. a bouldering gym with an outdoor area split into 'boulders').
