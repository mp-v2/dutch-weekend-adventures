Belgium has a lot of climbing, although quality can vary

- Freyr - sport climbing for those who like unnecessary run-outs

- Berdorf - sport climbing for everyone

- Dillingen - bouldering, although the area is not (technically) accessible. 
Still seems to have some ascents logged on 8a.nu though

Just over the border with Germany there is also:

- Ruhrtal - bouldering

- Avalonia - bouldering in a chossy but strange place that was sculpted by a fugitive climber who camped on the land for many years. He built stone artwork here and sold handdrawn guidebooks ..until the police caught up with him

- Isenburg - some sport climbing
